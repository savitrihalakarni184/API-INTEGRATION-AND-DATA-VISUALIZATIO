PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API with Python to fetch real-time data and transform it into meaningful insights through data visualization. By using the OpenWeatherMap API, the application collects weather-related information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a given city or region. The data is then processed and visualized using Matplotlib to create charts and graphs, helping users easily interpret weather trends.

The project can be extended to include multiple cities, time-series data, or comparisons between regions, making it an excellent example of combining API usage, data handling, and visualization skills.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:

Python – core programming language

Requests – to fetch data from the API

OpenWeatherMap API – public API to provide weather data

Matplotlib – for creating charts and visualizations

Pandas (optional, but useful) – for data manipulation and structuring


OBJECTIVES:

Learn how to integrate Python with public APIs.

Fetch and process real-time weather data.

Convert raw API responses into structured datasets.

Create clear and insightful visualizations (line charts, bar graphs, etc.) using Matplotlib.

Enhance data interpretation by representing information graphicall

FEATURES:

✅ API Integration: Connects to OpenWeatherMap (or any public API).

✅ City-based Query: User can enter a city name to fetch live weather data.

✅ Data Extraction: Collects temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.

✅ Data Visualization: Displays bar charts, line plots, or pie charts using Matplotlib.

✅ Historical/Comparative Analysis (optional): Visualize data trends over time or compare multiple cities.

✅ User-Friendly Output: Provides both textual and graphical representation of data.
